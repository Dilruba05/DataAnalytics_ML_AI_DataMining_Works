# NLP Discovery: Classification, Clustering, and Sentiment Analysis

## 📊 Dataset
**Twitter US Airline Sentiment**
* **Source:** A collection of ~14,640 tweets regarding major U.S. airlines.
* **Features:** Includes tweet text, sentiment labels (positive, neutral, negative), and metadata like negative reasons (e.g., "Late Flight" or "Customer Service Issue").

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the practical application of both **Supervised** and **Unsupervised Learning** in Natural Language Processing (NLP). By using real-world social media data, the project explores how machines can interpret human emotion and automatically organize large volumes of unstructured text into meaningful categories.

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed
1.  **Text Classification (Supervised):** Training a model to automatically sort tweets into three predefined categories: *Positive*, *Neutral*, or *Negative*. This simulates real-world systems like automated customer support routing.
2.  **Text Clustering (Unsupervised):** Grouping tweets based on semantic similarity without using labels. This helps discover "hidden" patterns, such as identifying a sudden cluster of complaints related specifically to "baggage" or "delays."
3.  **Sentiment Analysis:** Applying specialized NLP techniques to measure the emotional tone of the text. This task focuses on understanding the intensity and nature of public opinion toward different airline brands.
